Part 2 of Chapter 2 sees the CERFI group working through texts by
[[Marx]] on the opposition between the town/city and the country and
identifying the model for this opposition in the 'early' work (*The
German Ideology*) as town = civilization/country = barbarism; the town
is thus proposed as the 'Subject' or 'motor' of history. CERFI want to
question and critique this model; they show that it persists in the
later work (*Kapital*) but that Marx also abandons the town as a focus
or interest, in favour of a stress on the 'system'. They look closely
at [[Lefebvre]]'s *La Pensée marxiste et la ville* to criticise the
way Lefebvre also seems to 'subjectify' the city as a pure
('contentless') motor of history. This 'aporia', they say in a
footnote, determines the sociology of urbanism in its entirety,
referring to [[Raymond Ledrut]], *Sociologie urbaine* (PUF, 1968),
[[Pierre-Henri Derycke]], *L'économie urbaine* (PUF, 1970) and an
*Annales* issue, 'Histoire et urbanisation' from July-August 1970.
They are little more charitable to [[Manuel Castells]] (who had taken
up a post at the Ecole des Hautes études en sciences sociales in 1970)
whose first book, *La Question urbaine*, was published by the leftist
publisher Maspero in 1972, and which CERFI refer to as 'une véritable
somme'. Despite suggesting that Castells was 'formed' with Marx and
[[Althusser]], like them, they are critical of Castells' recourse to
the 'unscientific' concept of 'expression' -- the city as the
expression of a social structure -, adding that Althusser's
reconfiguration of Marxist concepts seemed to be disallowing any
engagement with the specificity of the problem. The city/town is thus
progressively evacuated as a working concept or problematic, and
shifted towards that of 'territory' (via reference to [[Lucien
Febvre]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], both of the Annales school -- though
Febvre is an earlier presence).

CERFI thus recognise the 'impasse' into which they have got
themselves: they are stuck with the city/country model, which is
confined within the space of representation and does not enable them
to think the forces at play; the 'genealogical' work is still to be
done. Again the reference to [[Nietzsche]] and [[Foucault]] comes in,
but awaits its fuller exposition in a later section.

The multi-factor title of the whole volume thus makes more sense now:
Genealogy of Capital 1. The Equipments of Power: towns, territories,
collective equipments \[I am keeping this translation strictly literal
for the time being\]. This is part 1 of a *genealogy* of capital \[part
2 is *L'Idéal historique*, which I will look at subsequently\]; the
*equipments of power* is a key expression; and there is a
translational/semantic crux here -- equipment - appears to be a term
related to the Ministry which has commissioned the research, but it
would be interesting to know more about the provenance of the term
itself.

[[Lévy|Françoise (Lévy)]]'s intervention clarifies that she wrote the
part on Marx, while [[Anne Querrien|Anne]] wrote the critique of Castells, which will
also be deferred until later. Françoise also says she is writing a
piece for *Esprit* and that she was attending Foucault's course. What
she says about Foucault's point on how the bourgeoisie 'naturalises
and animalises' those it wants to expel should allow us to date it.

### Chapter Three -- 'Les Territoires'

Begins with 'Le territoire despotique', and again the proximity with
AO Part 3, with which it shares common references ([[Wittfogel]],
[[Mumford]], [[Braudel]]) is evident. But there is also a strong
presence of the idea of power or will to power which brings forward
the Nietzsche-Foucault angle. NB. That Foucault's *cours* 71-73 was
*Leçons sur la volonté de savoir*. Should open a separate dossier on
that.

I've created a separate dossier on Nietzsche which is now quite
substantial (thus far). This occupied the intervening period up to the
next entry.

interesting lapsus around [[Jean Deshayes|Jean]]/[[Richard Deshayes]].*
