Since the last entry I have, true to what I said, been extending the
'Klossowski dossier'. This has included accumulating the bibliography
and sporadically parachuting in to the key texts, which include
*[[Nietzsche]] et le cercle vicieux, La Monnaie vivante*, but also critical
essays by [[Deleuze]] and [[Foucault]] (also [[Blanchot]] and [[Lyotard]]), and the
[[Klossowski]]-Deleuze correspondence. It is difficult to get hold of a
French edition of *La Monnaie vivante*, which, despite its brevity is
signalled as a major, unsurpassable work by Foucault and Deleuze alike.
But I have downloaded a rtf version of it and have the translation,
*Living Currency*, published by Bloomsbury in 2017. This also includes
'[[Sade]] and [[Fourier]]', a translation of a more or less contemporary (1970)
essay in the psychoanalytic (4th group) review *Topique*, special
issue on Fourier. The relevance for R13 is indirect, OK, but generally,
feeding through *Anti-Œdipe*, R13 relies on a 'theory of intensities'
which stems from Klossowski, via his readings of Nietzsche, but also
Sade. This connects with another of my research tasks which is to write
a chapter on *Tel Quel*, [[Sade]] and modernism. Klossowski's 'Sade ou le
philosophe scélérat' was originally a *Tel Quel* lecture from 1966. Plus
[[Fourquet]]'s text in R14 is *directly* influenced and informed by
Klossowskian theory, even if K is named only once; this revolves
specifically around the term 'suppôt' as outlined above. See the dossier
for more on this.

Coincidentally came across a chapter by [[Stuart Elden]] in M. Dillon and A.
Neal (eds.)*, Foucault on Politics, Security, and War* (Macmillan 2008)
called 'Strategies for Waging Peace: Foucault as *collaborateur*' which
has detailed discussion of R13. Have downloaded it from Stuart's blog
page and put it in the 'Documents' folder. It looks indispensable. It
looks like it is included in Elden's *The Birth of Power*.

Last week - borrowed [[Lyotard|JF Lyotard]]'s *Économie libidinale* -- from 1974 -
from the Maughan library. It has no index, but the usual quick leafing
turned up a reference to Fourquet's R14, p. 123., which relates to the
sense of guilt and *ressentiment* of the (Marxist) militant ideal. There
is extensive discussion of Klossowski, including to *La Monnaie
vivante*, pp. 17-115.
