Our research project, *The Pragmatic Genealogy of Concepts* funded by a
Small Grant from the British Academy and Leverhulme Trust, concerns, as
its primary object, an issue of the journal *Recherches* (number 13)
from December 1973, which bears the title *La Généalogie du capital: les
équipments du pouvoir*. The issue is the result of a working group of
the organisation CERFI (Centre d'études, de recherches et de formation
institutionelles), established by French activist, psychiatrist and
philosopher Félix Guattari in 1965.

Our interest in *Recherches* 13 and the contexts around it is multiple,
but may be usefully grouped around the following factors:

-   The object itself, the journal issue, is a collectively written
    text, which, as well as foregrounding the process of the research
    that informed it and the process of its own composition, bears
    witness to an experiment in collective research activity, in the
    research life of the group. The issue includes several 'militant
    interventions' by the female members of the research collective,
    which discuss the affective elements of their investment in the
    project, and the conflicts and tensions which characterised the work
    of the collective.

-   The issue appears at a significant point in the history of leftist
    militancy in France in the years following May 1968. It is
    symptomatic of a response and a mode of action different from that
    of Maoist groups such as the Gauche proletairienne. Together with
    the next issue of the journal (14), presented as Part 2 of the
    *Généalogie du capital*, this one written by François Fourquet
    alone, it proposes a critical analysis of what was referred to as
    the 'militant ideal'.

-   The Genealogy project involves a significant engagement with
    theoretical ideas and concepts drawn from the work of French
    philosophers Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and
    to a lesser extent the historian Fernand Braudel (inventor of the
    *longue durée*), Jean-Paul Sartre and Friedrich Nietzsche. The
    period in which the project evolved coincided with the composition
    and publication of Deleuze and Guattari's *Anti-Oedipus*, with the
    first years of Michel Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France
    on the will-to-know and on State institutions, as well as with
    Foucault and Deleuze's engagement in militant activity with the
    *Groupe d'Information sur les prisons*. In a wider sense, and in
    tandem with the work of Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, *Recherches*
    13 marks a decisive shift away from the paradigmatic framework of
    Marxism and toward a Nietzschean emphasis on relations of power. The
    issue's account of collective equipment steps away from the
    discourse of social 'needs' in its incorporation of Nietzschean and
    Deleuze-Guattarian thematics of flow, capture, territorialisation,
    and the genealogy of these effects.

Our project thus combines a close focus on the process and dynamics of
collective research, especially as driven by an activist agenda oriented
toward social change, the evacuation of a critical moment in the history
of French critical theory, and analysis of the way in which concepts are
deployed in relation to specific elements of the social field, such as
cities, territories and 'équipements collectifs' referred to in
*Recherches 13* sub-title.

## La Toupie Folle

The project's alternative title 'la toupie folle' (the mad spinning top)
is taken from a description by Marie-Therese Vernet Straggiotti of the
affective and conceptual character of the research in the journal
itself.

*La toupie folle* **is an experiment in research and writing and the
work is recorded here as it develops in the making.** The site features
a regularly updated blog on the process of the research, as well as a
number of resources such as a Chronology, an Index of Names and of
Concepts as they relate to R13 and a number of 'dossiers' on salient
features of and around the work of the Genealogy group of CERFI. As part
of the project we will also engage in a dialogue series with researchers
whose work intersects with this research and a translation worlshops.

The project's researchers are Dr Susana Caló and Professor Patrick
ffrench who started working together after sharing an interest in
experimenting with collective practices of research. Their long-term
project is to write about what they call the Social Life of Concepts
in the case of post-war French thought.

In April 2022, they were joined by a research assistant, the brilliant
Dr Daniel Nemenyi, who is leading the website design as a research tool.

**Dr. Susana Caló** is a researcher in post-war histories of psychiatry,
semiotics, and social movements. She has published and presented widely
on the Institutional Psychotherapy movement, with a focus on linking
institutional analysis to broader militant and activist contexts. Her
research reconstructs neglected post-war histories of psychiatry in
their intersections with wider social-political and urban struggles. She
is a visiting research fellow at the Centre for Humanities and Health,
King's College London, a member of the collective *Other Ways to Care*,
and cofounder of *Chaosmosemedia*.

Over the course of 5 years she co-developed with Godofredo Pereira the
research project '[CERFI. Militant Analysis, Collective Equipment and
Institutional
Programming'](https://www.rca.ac.uk/research-innovation/projects/cerfi-militant-analysis-collective-equipment-and-institutional-programming/)
(link to
[here](https://www.rca.ac.uk/research-innovation/projects/cerfi-militant-analysis-collective-equipment-and-institutional-programming/))
recovering the overlooked conceptual and practical legacy of the
research cooperative CERFI (1967-1987) founded by Félix Guattari. This
involved in-depth interviews and conversations with CERFI's members
and collaborators, interviews with groups who have been influenced by
the legacy of CERFI, translations and extensive analysis of newly
found textual and visual archival material. The project received
support from the Graham Foundation, Royal College of Art and *Het*
Nieuwe Instituut.

She is currently working on the book's project titled 'CERFI. Militant
Analysis and Institutional Programming', forthcoming with Minor
Compositions.

**Professor Patrick ffrench** is Professor of French and former Vice
Dean (Research) at King's College. He wrote his phd on the French
literary and theoretical journal Tel Quel, in 1993, under the
supervision of Professor Annette Lavers at the University College
London. As a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at University College
he worked on Georges Bataille and 20th-century French intellectual
history, before moving to King's College London in 1999. The four books
that have resulted from this work are: *The Time of Theory: A History of
Tel Quel* (1996); *The Cut: reading Bataille's Story of the Eye* (2000);
*After Bataille: Sacrifice, Exposure, Community* (2007) and, co-edited and
translated with Roland-François Lack, *The Tel Quel Reader*
(2003).  Patrick's research ranges across French literature, philosophy
and culture of the 20th-century, with a particular focus on critical
theory, literature and film. He has written on Maurice Blanchot, Roland
Barthes, Jean-Luc Nancy, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. More
recently his work is about film philosophy and film theory; his two most
recent books focus on resonances of a cinematographic imaginary in
Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu (*Thinking Cinema with Proust*,
Legenda, 2018) and cinema in the work of Roland Barthes (*Roland Barthes
and Film*, Bloomsbury, 2019).

**Dr. Daniel Nemenyi** is a researcher in the philosophy of
cybernetics and the history of computing. He specialises in Norbert
Wiener and is currently preparing his PhD thesis, *What is an
internet? Norbert Wiener and the society of control* (Centre for
Research in Modern European Philosophy (CRMEP) Kingston University,
2019) for publication. He is a member of the *[Radical
Philosophy](https://www.radicalphilosophy.com)* editorial collective,
a visiting researcher at King's College London Department of Digital
Humanities, and is an [independent web
developer](https://danielnemenyi.net/). He built this website.
